#Task4Squares.client

One page web application, build using React

##Run
First of all you should install [npm](https://www.npmjs.org), of course :).
Npm packages than.

```sh
> npm install
```
Task4Squares web client uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for module bundling, including js, css, less and images.

Run webpack before starting http server:
```sh
> webpack
```
Now you could start any http server you like, for example:
```sh
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
But if you want to get all the opportunities of hot reloading, plz, use [node](http://nodejs.org NodeJs official page) server
```sh
> node server
```
